Part 1: no concurrency
1. Show the output from the ps command.
    mrc621@hornet:~/cs324/ConcurrencyExample$ ps -Lo user,pid,ppid,nlwp,lwp,state,ucmd -C echoserveri | grep ^username\\\|mrc621
    mrc621    6167  1982    1  6167 S echoserveri

2. From the ps output, how many processes and how many threads are running, and why?  Use the PID and LWP to identify different threads or processes.
    1 processes, 1 thread - Because this server is not concurrent in any way, so it can only handle one connection at a time

3. Enter "Ctrl-c" on the window in which "nc" was first executed to interrupt it.  What happens to the "nc" processes in the other windows?
    The next "nc" process gets the echo back from the server, while the third process is still waiting

Part 2: Process-based Concurrency
4.Show the output from the ps command.
    mrc621@hornet:~/cs324/ConcurrencyExample$ ps -Lo user,pid,ppid,nlwp,lwp,state,ucmd -C echoserverp | grep ^username\\\|mrc621
    mrc621    7539  1982    1  7539 S echoserverp
    mrc621    7557  7539    1  7557 S echoserverp
    mrc621    7563  7539    1  7563 S echoserverp
    mrc621    7568  7539    1  7568 S echoserverp

5. From the ps output, how many processes and how many threads are running, and why?  Use the PID and LWP to identify different threads or processes.
    4 processes, with a thread each - Because we fork to be able handle messages concurrency on unique processes?

Part 3: Simple Thread-based Concurrency
6. Show the output from the ps command.
    mrc621@hornet:~/cs324/ConcurrencyExample$ ps -Lo user,pid,ppid,nlwp,lwp,state,ucmd -C echoservert | grep ^username\\\|mrc621
    mrc621    7894  1982    4  7894 S echoservert
    mrc621    7894  1982    4  7903 S echoservert
    mrc621    7894  1982    4  7911 S echoservert
    mrc621    7894  1982    4  7920 S echoservert

7. From the ps output, how many processes and how many threads are running, and why?  Use the PID and LWP to identify different threads or processes.
    1 process, 4 threads - Because we only use one process now and spin up the threads we need as we need them

Part 4: Threadpool-based Concurrency
8. Show the output from the ps command.
    mrc621@hornet:~/cs324/ConcurrencyExample$ ps -Lo user,pid,ppid,nlwp,lwp,state,ucmd -C echoservert_pre | grep ^username\\\|mrc621
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8551 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8552 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8553 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8554 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8555 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8556 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8557 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8558 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8559 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8560 S echoservert_pre
    mrc621    8551  1982   11  8561 S echoservert_pre

9. From the ps output, how many processes and how many threads are running, and why?  Use the PID and LWP to identify different threads or processes.
    1 process, 11 threads - Because we use one process to create a predetermined number of threads for our uses?

Part 5: Concurrency Review
Name at least one pro and one con to each of the concurrent programming paradigms in this assignment.  You can use your own observations, as well as the book chapter.

10. echoserverp - process-based (using fork()) concurrency
    Pro: Simpler to program (simply create a new process to handle a new connection)
    Con: Lots of processes (n number of processes | n = num(connections)) (which can be heavy)

11. echoservert - simple thread-based concurrency (threads created on the fly)
    Pro: Only one process reguardless of how many threads
    Con: We have to spin up each new thread on the fly when we get to the point that we need it

12. echoservert_pre - thread-based concurrency using a thread-pool
    Pro: All threads are genereated before
    Con: ???

Consider the code in echoservert_pre.c for the following questions:
13. Which statement of code represents the producer role?  How many producer threads are there?
    sbuf_init(&sbuf, SBUFSIZE); //line:conc:pre:initsbuf
	for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++)  /* Create worker threads */ //line:conc:pre:begincreate
		pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread, NULL);               //line:conc:pre:endcreate
    1 producer thread

14. Which statement of code represents the consumer role?  How many consumer threads are there?
	while (1) {
		clientlen = sizeof(struct sockaddr_storage);
		connfd = accept(listenfd, (struct sockaddr *) &clientaddr, &clientlen);
		sbuf_insert(&sbuf, connfd); /* Insert connfd in buffer */
	}
    10 consumer threads
    

Consider the code in sbuf.c for the following questions (P() is equivalent to sem_wait() and V() is equivalent to sem_post()):
15. On line 29, what happens when the value of slots is zero?
    We wait until on become available

16. In the case that a single consumer thread is sleeping at line 42, waiting for a non-zero value of items, what line of code will be executed by a producer to wake that thread up?
    pthread_create()
